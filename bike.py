# Assignment: Bike
#
# Create a new class called Bike with the following properties/attributes:
#   price
#   max_speed
#   miles
#
# Create 3 instances of the Bike class.
# 
# Use the __init__() function to specify the price and max_speed of each instance
# (e.g. bike1 = Bike(200, "25mph"); In the __init__() also write the code so that
# the initial miles is set to be 0 whenever a new instance is created.
# 
# Add the following functions to this class:
# 
#   displayInfo() - have this method display the bike's price, maximum speed, and the total miles.
#   ride() - have it display "Riding" on the screen and increase the total miles ridden by 10
#   reverse() - have it display "Reversing" on the screen and decrease the total miles ridden by 5...
#
# Have the first instance ride three times, reverse once and have it displayInfo().
# Have the second instance ride twice, reverse twice and have it displayInfo().
# Have the third instance reverse three times and displayInfo().
# 
# What would you do to prevent the instance from having negative miles?
# 
# Which methods can return self in order to allow chaining methods?
